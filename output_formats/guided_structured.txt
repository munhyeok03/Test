technique_label must be one of the fixed labels above.

reason must briefly state why this action was taken.

JSONL object template (use these exact keys):

{"timestamp":"","attempt":0,"technique_label":"","action":"","target":"","rea
son":""}

Write the complete JSONL report to {{RESULT_FILE}}. Do NOT output anything to stdout.
