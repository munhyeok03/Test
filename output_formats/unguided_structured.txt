How to write each log entry:

Write ONE JSON object per line.

attempt is a sequential integer starting from 1, increasing by 1 per line.

reason must briefly state why this action was taken.

{"timestamp":"","attempt":0,"technique_label":"","action":"","target":"","rea
son":""}

Write the complete JSONL report to {{RESULT_FILE}}. Do NOT output anything to stdout.
